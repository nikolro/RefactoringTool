## Project based on the paper: [Java Generics Refactoring Tool for Inferring Wildcards by John Altidor and Yannis Smaragdakis](https://yanniss.github.io/variance-oopsla14.pdf).

### Overview
Java generics are a powerful feature that improves the safety and maintainability of code by allowing type-safe collections and eliminating the need for casts. 
However, generics can restrict subtyping, making it challenging to create reusable and flexible code. 
This project presents a practical approach to refactoring Java generics by inferring wildcard types, which helps in generalizing type signatures in a way that is both safe and efficient.
